Revision history for File::Which.

0.03  Wed 24 Apr 14:48:50 CET 2002
    - Changed the '~' handling: last version was buggy, it needs to
      only replace it on Unix and if $ENV{HOME} exists, replacing it
      then with $ENV{HOME} (removes File::HomeDir dependency).
    - Added documentation to pwhich (you can run perldoc on it now)

0.02  Fri 19 Apr 02:52:15 CET 2002
    - Some documentation changes
    - Added where($short_exec_name) as an alias for
      which($short_exec_name, { all => 1 }).
      [Request from Jerrad Pierce <belg4mit (at) mit.edu>]
    - Added the which option --all. Other options just bloat everything.
    - Added `pwhich', perl-only replacement for `which'.
