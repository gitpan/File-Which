File::Which version 0.01
========================

File::Which is a portable implementation (in Perl) of `which', and can be
used to get the absolute filename of an executable program installed
somewhere in your PATH, or just check for its existence.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Using the CPAN shell:

   perl -MCPAN -eshell
   cpan> install File::Which
   cpan> exit


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  File::Spec

TODO

In the future, I would like to add support for most options `which'
supports, as well as a Perl-only replacement for `which'.
