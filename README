File::Which
===========

File::Which is a portable implementation (in Perl) of `which', and can
be used to get the absolute filename of an executable program
installed somewhere in your PATH, or just check for its existence. It
includes the command-line utility `pwhich' which has the same function
as `which'.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following (on Windows, use `nmake',
which can be obtained freely from Microsoft: see ActivePerl
documentation):

   $ tar zxvf File-Which-x.xx.tar.gz  (replace x.xx with the correct version number)
   $ cd File-Which-x.xx
   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

Using the CPAN shell:

   $ perl -MCPAN -eshell
   cpan> install File::Which
   cpan> exit

TESTING

When you run `make test', File::Which will test some of its
functionality. It uses the t/test-bin/ directory for this, treating
the files below it as programs.

The tests might still be a bit shaky because there is a bit of magic
involved in doing this -- please report any problems you might have.

Furthermore, the files under t/test-bin/ are *not* supposed to be
executed: do so at your own risk. Especially, the *.exe files are not
valid applications as they aren't compiled and might make your system
crash or whatever. Execute them at your own risk. (But don't worry,
this package doesn't bite otherwise :)
